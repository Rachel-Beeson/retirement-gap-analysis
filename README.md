# retirement-gap-analysis
Data analytics project examining gender disparities in retirement readiness using Federal Reserve survey data

📊 Project Overview
Business Question: How do retirement readiness metrics differ between genders, and what actionable insights can financial services companies use to address these gaps?
Key Finding: Female-headed households face a 6-times retirement savings gap ($742K vs $118K), driven by systematic exclusion from wealth-building activities during critical earning years.
Impact: Analysis reveals a trillion-dollar market opportunity for targeted financial products addressing the 24% of households that are systematically underserved.

🎯 Key Findings
6X Retirement Savings Gap: Male-headed households average $742K vs female-headed households' $118K
Investment Participation Crisis: Female stock ownership drops to 8% during prime wealth-building years (35-49)
Double Gap Discovery: Both participation rates AND investment amounts lag significantly
Market Opportunity: 5,490 female-headed households (24% of sample) represent trillion-dollar opportunity
